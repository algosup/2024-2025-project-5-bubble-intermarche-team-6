## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Overview

Our web application is designed to enhance the customer experience at Intermarch√© by helping users find the perfect wine and cheese pairings. The app guides users through a smooth, decision-tree-based flow where they can start from a dish, a cheese, or a wine and receive tailored recommendations.

The application will guide users through a series of simple and user-friendly steps that simulate sommelier-like expertise. Depending on the user‚Äôs input (dish, wine, or cheese), the app will return the most appropriate product matches. It supports both casual users looking for inspiration and gourmet shoppers seeking the perfect pairing.
