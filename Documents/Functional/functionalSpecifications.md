## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Overview

Our web application is designed to enhance the customer experience at Intermarch√© by helping users find the perfect wine and cheese pairings. The app guides users through a smooth, decision-tree-based flow where they can start from a dish, a cheese, or a wine and receive tailored recommendations.

The application will guide users through a series of simple and user-friendly steps that simulate sommelier-like expertise. Depending on the user‚Äôs input (dish, wine, or cheese), the app will return the most appropriate product matches. It supports both casual users looking for inspiration and gourmet shoppers seeking the perfect pairing.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Global User Flow

The flowchart below provides an overview of the app‚Äôs core decision-making logic, from homepage to final recommendation.

![flowchart](img/flowchart.png)


*(As the diagram is quite detailed, it is recommended to zoom in for better readability.)*

### 3.2. Visual Design

To create our mockups, we used Figma, a collaborative design tool that allows for easy sharing and feedback. The mockups are designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and ease of navigation.

Here is the link to the Figma file: [Figma Mockups](https://www.figma.com/design/wQ7NaObzJ04TrvweCbxS5Z/Intermarch%C3%A9?node-id=0-1&t=2GPKpLDiJrA0HViY-1)

---

#### 3.2.1 Color Palette

The color palette was designed to balance brand recognition, visual clarity, and mobile usability ‚Äî especially for in-store browsing scenarios.

##### Primary Colors

- **Bright Red**<span style="display:inline-block;width:12px;height:12px;background:#FF0000;border:1px solid #ccc;border-radius:2px;margin-left:6px;"></span> **(#FF0000)**  
Chosen as the primary accent color, used for key interactive elements such as the active menu icon or call-to-action buttons. While our initial intention was to use **Intermarch√©‚Äôs official red**, we found that it did not render well across all devices and backgrounds. #FF0000 offered stronger contrast, better visibility on white and grey backgrounds, and preserved the strong, energetic identity associated with the Intermarch√© brand.

- **Dark Grey**<span style="display:inline-block;width:12px;height:12px;background:#868686;border:1px solid #ccc;border-radius:2px;margin-left:6px;"></span> **(#868686)**  
Used for headers, borders, and the top bar background. This neutral tone provides depth and separates UI elements without overwhelming the design.

##### Neutrals & Backgrounds

- **White**<span style="display:inline-block;width:12px;height:12px;background:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #ccc;border-radius:2px;margin-left:6px;"></span> **(#FFFFFF)**  
Serves as the primary background to ensure maximum contrast with product images and text.

- **Light Grey**<span style="display:inline-block;width:12px;height:12px;background:#DEDEDE;border:1px solid #ccc;border-radius:2px;margin-left:6px;"></span> **(#DEDEDE)**  
Used for inactive elements, search bars, and separators to maintain visual structure without adding clutter.

##### Accent Colors

- **Gold-Yellow**<span style="display:inline-block;width:12px;height:12px;background:#E9BC08;border:1px solid #ccc;border-radius:2px;margin-left:6px;"></span> **(#E9BC08)**  
Used for the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù star icon. It evokes the idea of personal curation and premium selection, tying into the gourmet nature of the app.

The final palette ensures a clean, professional appearance while optimizing for **legibility, usability**, and **emotional impact**, particularly in a retail environment.



### 3.3 Homepage & Navigation

The homepage is the user‚Äôs first touchpoint with the app and serves as the launchpad for product discovery. It allows users to search for cheeses or wines, view best-selling items, and navigate to core features like Favorites and Settings.

#### Visual Structure

The screen is divided into three key zones:

1. **Search Bar (Top)**
   - A prominent input field labeled ‚ÄúRechercher un produit...‚Äù allows users to search for a cheese or wine by name.
   - The search field includes a magnifying glass icon for intuitive interaction.
   - Designed to be large and accessible on mobile screens.

2. **Best Sellers Section (Middle)**
   - Below the search bar, a heading ‚ÄúMeilleures ventes‚Äù introduces a curated product list.
   - Two filter buttons (‚ÄúFromages‚Äù and ‚ÄúVins‚Äù) let the user toggle the product type.
     - When ‚ÄúFromages‚Äù is active, the list shows best-selling cheeses.
     - When ‚ÄúVins‚Äù is active, the list displays top-selling wines.
   - Each product is shown in a horizontal card layout:
     - Product image
     - Name
     - Tags (e.g., ‚ÄúOnctueux‚Äù, ‚ÄúD√©licat‚Äù, ‚ÄúFruit√©‚Äù, etc.)
     - Price (‚Ç¨/kg for cheese, ‚Ç¨/bottle for wine)
     - A star icon that allows users to **favorite** the item

3. **Bottom Navigation Bar**
   - Fixed and accessible at all times.
   - Includes three main actions:
     - üè† **Menu**: Returns to the homepage (highlighted in red when active)
     - ‚≠ê **Favoris**: Takes users to their saved favorites
     - ‚öôÔ∏è **Param√®tres**: Opens the settings screen

![img](img/homepage.png)

#### Functional Expectations

- The homepage must always reflect the most recent product data (e.g., stock, price).
- Tapping a product card should lead to a **Product Detail View**.

### 3.4 Product Detail View

This screen provides users with an in-depth look at a selected product (wine or cheese), including its characteristics, description, and pairing suggestions. It‚Äôs a key part of the user journey, especially for those making in-store decisions or exploring expert recommendations.

#### Visual Structure

1. **Header Zone**
   - A back arrow allows the user to return to the previous screen.
   - A star icon in the top-right corner lets the user favorite the item for quick access later.
   - The background bar is styled in grey to visually separate the header from the content area.

     - Optional tags or notes (if applicable)

5. **Bottom Navigation Bar**
   - Consistent with other screens:
     - **Menu**, **Favoris**, **Param√®tres**

![img](img/product.png)


#### Functional Expectations

- Users must be able to **favorite** or **unfavorite** the product by tapping the star icon.

### 3.5 Favorites Page

The ‚ÄúFavoris‚Äù page allows users to view all previously saved items ‚Äî both cheeses and wines ‚Äî that they marked with the ‚≠ê icon. It acts as a personal shortlist for users who want to revisit their selections, especially when they‚Äôre actively shopping or planning meals.

#### Visual Structure

1. **Header**
   - Title displayed at the top of the screen: **‚ÄúMes favoris‚Äù**
   - Clean white background for consistency with other pages

2. **Favorites List**

![img](img/favorites.png)

#### Functional Behavior

- The list must include **both wines and cheeses**, displayed in the order they were favorited (most recent first).
- Tapping a product card should open its **Product Detail View** (see Section 3.3).
- Tapping the filled star icon removes the item from the favorites list.
  - The item should disappear immediately via smooth animation.
- If no items are saved, display an empty state message such as:
  > ‚ÄúVous n'avez pas encore ajout√© de favoris.‚Äù  
  > *(‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt added any favorites yet.‚Äù)*

#### Example User Flow

1. The user taps the ‚≠ê ‚ÄúFavoris‚Äù icon in the bottom navigation.
2. They see four saved products: two cheeses and two wines.
3. They scroll through the list and tap ‚ÄúVin Ros√© IGP Alpilles.‚Äù
4. The app navigates to the detailed view for that wine.
5. They return and tap the ‚≠ê next to ‚ÄúMorbier‚Äù to remove it from favorites.
6. The item disappears from the list instantly.
