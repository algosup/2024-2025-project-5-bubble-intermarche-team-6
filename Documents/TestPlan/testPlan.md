## I. Introduction

### A. Product Overview

**Bubble Intermarché** is a simple and smart product assistant that helps customers in Intermarché stores:

- Find products easily by **addressing and locating them inside the store** (aisle-level geolocation).
- Get **precise product suggestions** based on natural input like `"red wine"` or `"goat's cheese"`.
- Browse organized **product categories** (e.g., Alcohol, Cheeses, Bio products).
- Support **both English and French** for broader accessibility.

⚠️ This is a **prototype (Proof of Concept)** – strict adherence to Intermarché's official brand identity is not required.
