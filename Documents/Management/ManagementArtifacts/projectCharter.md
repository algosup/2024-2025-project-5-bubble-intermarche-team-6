## Deadlines

Below are the key project deadlines set by the client to ensure a smooth and organized development process:

| Deliverable              | Description                                                                                                   | Deadline       |

| Technical Specification  | Describes the underlying technical requirements and architecture.                                             | 28/05/2025     |
| Test Plan                | Outlines the testing process and includes all test cases.                                                     | 06/06/2025     |
| Code Delivery            | Complete source code of the application.                                                                      | 16/06/2025     |

> ⚠️ Note: Delivery of the user manual is not a priority. Due to time constraints and the departure of developers before the project end, focus will remain on delivering the core product.

## Scope

### Project Goals

- Build a multilingual application using **Bubble** for Intermarché.
- Design a clean, user-friendly interface.
  - Streamline navigation and data access with minimal friction.
- Support French and English languages.
- Integrate product data (cheese & wine) provided by the client.

---

### Core Requirements

- Use **Bubble** exclusively for implementation.
- Ensure full **mobile-first** compatibility.
- Deliver a smooth and efficient user experience.
- Prioritize simplicity and usability.
- Optimize for speed and responsiveness.

---

## Project Limitations

### Constraints

- Minimum of 2 languages supported: **French** and **English**.
- Development must remain within the limitations of the **Bubble** platform.
- **Collaboration limitation**: Bubble's free plan doesn't allow simultaneous editing.
  - Workarounds:
    - Shared team account (all members use one account).
    - Use of a trial period (requires scheduling to avoid expiration before project ends).
- Communication with the client must be clear and not overwhelming.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                                                                 | Priority   | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform limitations on collaboration                               | High       | Use a shared account or stagger use of free trial periods.                         |
| Developer availability (leaving before project completion)          | High       | Focus on completing critical features early and document extensively.              |
| Unclear client expectations                                          | Medium     | Schedule regular and focused updates, confirm decisions in writing.               |
| Missing the user manual deadline                                     | Low        | Keep the client informed; ensure the app is intuitive enough without documentation.|
