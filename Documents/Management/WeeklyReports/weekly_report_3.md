* Document advancement:

  * Functional
  * Technical
  * Management
  * QA
* Exploring ideas for peer collaboration

### Progress Summary

* Documentation skeletons are completed and most are already underway.
* The functional document, which is our first deliverable, is more advanced than the others.
* The database plan is in progress and will be finished by the end of the day for review next week.
* Project charter under management is nearly complete.
* A review plan has been initiated: once a section of a document is completed, the QA member will review it immediately.

### Challenges Encountered

* The developer on the team has expressed unwillingness to code and stated he will be leaving soon, so we cannot assign him development tasks.
* Bubble (free version) allows only one person to work on the project at a time; we need to find a solution, as no one can handle both their tasks and full app development alone.
* We're slightly behind my initial plan due to a lack of team members, but still within the project timeline.
* Maintaining English throughout the entire session remains challenging; I will try a different approach next week.
