| Creation Date  | April 28, 2025    |
| Last Update    | April 28, 2025    |

---

### Focused Objectives

- Took detailed notes during the client meeting to ensure a complete understanding before initiating work.
- Discussed and clarified gathered information to establish a common understanding among team members.
- Organized key information by priority and feasibility within the given timeframe.
- Created the GitHub repository and set up the main branches.
- Began individual research on team roles and relevant documentation.

---

### Progress Summary

- The project required time to define a clear and structured approach.
- Some essential information was initially missing, which slowed progress.
- GitHub repository was successfully created with the necessary branch structure.
- Role research progressed well, as most team members had some prior knowledge of their responsibilities.

---

### Challenges Encountered

- One team member was absent throughout the week, including the project kickoff session.
- Initial lack of clarity regarding the project scope and Git structure delayed setup.
- It was surprising that the call for tender had to be created by us rather than being provided.
- Limited knowledge about wine and cheese within the team made it challenging to understand the reference materials and gather relevant information.

## Week 2 – April 28 to April 30, 2025  

| Information    | Details           |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Owner          | Alexandre Bopp    |
| Creation Date  | April 30, 2025    |
| Last Update    | April 30, 2025    |

---

### Focused Objectives

- Consolidate and document all team ideas.
- Begin gathering information and relevant documentation.
- Start building the foundation of the mockup.
- Maintain clear communication and mutual support within the team.

---

### Progress Summary

- From a management perspective, the first weekly report and project charter are completed or nearly finalized.
- Both the Program Manager and Technical Leader worked on flowcharts to provide a clear vision for upcoming tasks and began outlining their respective deliverables.
- The Technical Leader began researching useful Bubble plugins that could enhance our project.
- The Developer, who was not present during some of the Bubble sessions (including today's), spent time learning the platform and experimenting independently.
- The QA started an initial test phase to explore how to implement automated tests in Bubble and began outlining his own documentation structure.

---

### Challenges Encountered

- One team member was absent for half of the sessions, requiring communication via messages, which proved less efficient than in-person collaboration.
- We initially struggled to maintain English throughout the sessions due to low motivation, but expect improvements next week.
- My limited experience in management led to a few mistakes that slightly slowed progress; I recognize the need to improve and better fulfill my role.
- It remains challenging to find reliable information about wine and cheese pairings for the project.

## Week 3 – May 5 to May 7, 2025

| Information   | Details        |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Owner         | Alexandre Bopp |
| Creation Date | May 7, 2025    |
| Last Update   | May 7, 2025    |

---

### Focused Objectives

- Focus on mockups
- Database planning (not direct implementation): tables/relationships
- Document advancement:

  - Functional
  - Technical
  - Management
  - QA
- Exploring ideas for peer collaboration

---

### Progress Summary

- Documentation skeletons are completed and most are already underway.
- The functional document, which is our first deliverable, is more advanced than the others.
- The database plan is in progress and will be finished by the end of the day for review next week.
- Project charter under management is nearly complete.
- A review plan has been initiated: once a section of a document is completed, the QA member will review it immediately.

---

### Challenges Encountered

- The developer on the team has expressed unwillingness to code and stated he will be leaving soon, so we cannot assign him development tasks.
- Bubble (free version) allows only one person to work on the project at a time; we need to find a solution, as no one can handle both their tasks and full app development alone.
- We're slightly behind my initial plan due to a lack of team members, but still within the project timeline.
- Maintaining English throughout the entire session remains challenging; I will try a different approach next week.
