### Progress Summary

- From a management perspective, the first weekly report and project charter are completed or nearly finalized.
- Both the Program Manager and Technical Leader worked on flowcharts to provide a clear vision for upcoming tasks and began outlining their respective deliverables.
- The Technical Leader began researching useful Bubble plugins that could enhance our project.
- The Developer, who was not present during some of the Bubble sessions (including today's), spent time learning the platform and experimenting independently.
- The QA started an initial test phase to explore how to implement automated tests in Bubble and began outlining his own documentation structure.

### Challenges Encountered

- One team member was absent for half of the sessions, requiring communication via messages, which proved less efficient than in-person collaboration.
- We initially struggled to maintain English throughout the sessions due to low motivation, but expect improvements next week.
- My limited experience in management led to a few mistakes that slightly slowed progress; I recognize the need to improve and better fulfill my role.
- It remains challenging to find reliable information about wine and cheese pairings for the project.
