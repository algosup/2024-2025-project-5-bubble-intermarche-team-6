### Challenges Encountered

- Development has gained momentum now that two team members are dedicated to it  
- A significant amount of time was spent on management artifacts, causing delays on other tasks (including weekly reports)  
- Bubble limitations (CSV import) are becoming a constraint – we plan to activate the free trial soon to access full features
